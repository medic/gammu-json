JSMN
====

jsmn (pronounced like 'jasmine') is a minimalistic JSON parser in C.  It can be
easily integrated into resource-limited or embedded projects.

You can find more information about JSON format at [json.org][1]

Library sources are available at [bitbucket.org/zserge/jsmn][2]

Philosophy
----------

Most JSON parsers offer you a bunch of functions to load JSON data, parse it,
and extract any value by its name. The author of jsmn believes that checking
the correctness of every JSON packet or allocating temporary objects to store
parsed JSON fields often is an overkill. 

The JSON format itself is extremely simple, so why should we complicate it?

The jsmn library is designed to be  **robust** (it should work fine even with
erroneous data), **fast** (it should parse data on the fly), **portable** (no
superfluous dependencies or non-standard C extensions). **Simplicity** is also
a key feature -- simple code style, simple algorithm, simple integration into
other projects.

Features
--------

* Compatible with C89
* No dependencies (even libc!)
* Highly portable (tested on x86/amd64, ARM, AVR)
* About 200 lines of code
* Extremely small code footprint
* API contains only 2 functions
* No dynamic memory allocation
* Incremental single-pass parsing
* Library code is covered with unit tests

Design
------

The rudimentary jsmn object is a **token**. Let's consider a JSON string:

    '{ "name" : "Jack", "age" : 27 }'

It holds the following tokens:

* Object: `{ "name" : "Jack", "age" : 27}` (the whole object)
* Strings: `"name"`, `"Jack"`, `"age"` (keys and some values)
* Number: `27`

In jsmn, tokens do not hold any data, but instead point to token boundaries in
the original JSON string. In the example above, jsmn will create tokens like
this: Object [0..31], String [3..7], String [12..16], String [20..23], Number
[27..29].

Every jsmn token has a type, which indicates the type of corresponding JSON
token. The jsmn library supports the following token types:

* Object: a container of key-value pairs, e.g.:
    `{ "foo":"bar", "x":0.3 }`
* Array: a sequence of values, e.g.:
    `[ 1, 2, 3 ]`
* String: a quoted sequence of chars, e.g.: `"foo"`
* Primitive: a number, a boolean value (i.e. `true` or `false`), or `null`

Besides start/end positions, jsmn tokens for complex types (like arrays
or objects) also contain a number of child items, so you can easily follow
object hierarchy.

This approach provides enough information to parse any JSON data,a and makes it
possible to use zero-copy techniques.

Install
-------

To clone the original source repository, you must have Mercurial installed.
Just run:

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/zserge/jsmn jsmn

The jsmn repository layout is simple: jsmn.c and jsmn.h are library files, the
README and LICENSE files provide documentation, and the Makefile can be used
with GNU make to build jsmn.

To build the library, run `make`. If build was successful, you should get a
`libjsmn.a` library.  The header file you should include is called `"jsmn.h"`.

API
---

Token types are described by `jsmntype_t`:

    typedef enum {
        JSMN_OBJECT,
        JSMN_ARRAY,
        JSMN_STRING,
        JSMN_PRIMITIVE
    } jsmntype_t;

Unlike JSON data types, primitive tokens are not divided into numbers, booleans
and null, because one can easily tell the type using the first character:

* <code>'t', 'f'</code> - boolean 
* <code>'n'</code> - null
* <code>'-', '0'..'9'</code> - number

Token is an object of `jsmntok_t` type:

    typedef struct {
        jsmntype_t type; // Token type
        int start;       // Token start position
        int end;         // Token end position
        int size;        // Number of child (nested) tokens
    } jsmntok_t;

String tokens point to the first character after the opening quote and the
previous symbol before final quote. This was made to simplify string extraction
from JSON data.

All parsing is done by `jsmn_parser` object. You can initialize a new parser
using:

    struct jsmn_parser parser;
    jsmntok_t tokens[10];

    // js - pointer to JSON string
    // tokens - an array of tokens available
    // 10 - number of tokens available
    jsmn_init_parser(&parser, js, tokens, 10);

This will create a parser that can parse up to 10 JSON tokens from `js` string.

Later, you can use `jsmn_parse(&parser)` function to parse a JSON string using
the JSON parser.  If something goes wrong, you will get an error. Error will be
one of these:

* `JSMN_SUCCESS` - everything went fine. String was parsed
* `JSMN_ERROR_INVAL` - bad token, JSON string is corrupted
* `JSMN_ERROR_NOMEM` - not enough tokens, JSON string is too large
* `JSMN_ERROR_PART` - JSON string is too short, expecting more JSON data

If you receive the `JSON_ERROR_NOMEM` error, you can re-allocate more tokens
and call `jsmn_parse` once more. If you are reading JSON data from a stream,
you can periodically call `jsmn_parse` and check if the return value is
`JSON_ERROR_PART`.  You will get this error until you reach the end of JSON
data.
